# Sport API specifications

This repository contains [OpenAPI 3.0](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification files for the NHL API.

Original repo forked to allow latest updates to newest NHL API, recently released discretely. This repo is still under construction, and I wouldn't recommend using it at this time, unless you're submitting PRs for fixes.

These APIs are all unofficially documented, so this data has been painstakingly compiled with help from various sources on the Internet. The data served by these APIs are owned by the respective leagues, and these API specifications are provided for informational purposes and I take zero responsibility for how you use them.
